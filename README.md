# Mobile-Project-Security-Recommendations
****Project Phase 6: Security Recommendations
a.	What is your security recommendation? Why did you choose it?
Recommendation: encryption of sensitive
Reason: personal  data is important including sensitive information like track of the user, financial or business information.
b.	Who does the recommendation benefit (end-user, developer, etc.)?
Users: user’s information could be safe by being protected
Developer: the data could be protected from damage
Company: protect their reputation and avoid legal issues
c.	If the recommendation was found somewhere other than the provided checklist, include a link to it. 
https://mas.owasp.org/
d.	When would the recommendation have to be implemented (based on how serious the security risk is)?
During design phase we should consider this. Especially before deployment. Any phase without security would take risks of the data.
e.	Why do you think your project needs your recommendation?
Because personal data is important to users. Data protection can make sure reduce or minimize the loss of the users’ sensitive data being stolen and the reputation and economy loss of the company that holds the data.
f.	How do you think your recommendation could be applied?
Our application can use AES and TLS for encrypting data in transit
i.	How feasible would the implementation be?
Our app has built-in libraries and tools to encrypt the data.
